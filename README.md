# Starknet P2P Integration and E2E Tests

This repository contains integration and e2e tests for the Starknet P2P. These tests ensure the reliability and performance of peer-to-peer interactions within the network.

## Test Description

- **Integration Tests**: These tests use a synthetic node to interact with target nodes via P2P. They verify the correctness of responses, check if node discovery is functioning, and ensure that connection negotiation works as expected.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: These tests run real nodes with different configurations and monitor their behavior to validate sync process.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the respective `README.md` files in the `integration/` and `e2e/` directories for detailed instructions.
